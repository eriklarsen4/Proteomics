# Proteomics
MS script analyzes protein interactions from HEKs transfected with mouse TMEM184B. This uses a raw MUDPIT CSV file.
  For AP/IP-MS, creates scatterplots of various data processing methods.
    Performs downstream functional analysis of select proteins as candidate TMEM184B binding partners.
        In progress: SAINT algorithm for determining "true positive" binding partner candidates (against "false positive"s);
        In progress: exporting interaction data compatible with cytoscape for protein-protein interaction network visualization.
        
Long-term goal: integration of proteomics data (PPI network) with transcriptomics data (WGCN) for a multi-omics network (+visualization).
